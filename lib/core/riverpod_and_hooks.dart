/// This file is used to export all the riverpod and hooks packages.
/// This is done to avoid importing the packages in every file.
/// It's also a central place to manage aliases, if needed.
///
/// To use this file, import it in every file that needs riverpod or hooks.
///
/// Do not import any other file from this package in other files.

/// Example:
/// import 'package:enterprise/core/riverpod_and_hooks.dart';
///
export 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';
export 'package:hooks_riverpod/hooks_riverpod.dart';
